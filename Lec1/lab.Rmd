# Introduction

## Motivation

In this lab, we are going to conduct exploratory data analysis for resale house price in Beijing, China.
There are several reasons for me to choose this dataset for you to practice. First, this is a raw dataset fetched from an online website. It contains many missing values, corrupted entries, and wrong data type encoding, which serves as a good practice for your data cleaning skills. Second, this dataset has various data type, for example, categorical variables, continuous variables, strings, links, and etc. This requires different data visualization skills. Finally, this is a large dataset that contains rich information and interesting patterns (more than 20 variables and around 300K records).

## Data Visualization

### Q5 Plot the Average Resale House Price Per Square After 2011 by District with Following Instructions

1. Label the figure title as "Average Resale House Price Per Square By District Over Time"
2. The figure should contain 13 lines with different colors. Each line represents one district.
3. Label y axis as "Average Price"
4. Set y axis limit as (10000, 110000)
5. Question: what is the general trend of the average price per square over time? which district has the highese average price per square?

**The average price per square tend to increase from 2012 to 2017 and decrease from 2017 onwards. District 10 has the highest average price per square**

```{r}
# Compute average price per square by district over time
data %>% subset(year >= 2012) %>%
  group_by(year, district) %>% summarise(ave_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = ave_price, group = district, color = district)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2012, 2018, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10000, 110000, 10000)) + 
  labs(title = "Average Resale House Price Per Square by District",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Price")
```

### Q6 Plot the Geographic Information by District with Following Instructions

1. Set Lng as x axis, Lat as y axis
2. Label the figure title as "Geographic Distribution by District"
3. Question: do you think geographic location is related to the average resale house price? 

**Yes, center of the city tends to have the higher average price, for example, district 10 and 1**

```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Lng, y =Lat, group = district, color = district)) +
  labs(title = "Geographic Distribution by District")
```

### Q7 Plot the Average Followers Over Time By District with Following Instructions

1. Label the figure title as "Average Followers By District Over Time"
2. The figure should contain 13 lines with different colors. Each line represents one district.
3. Label x axis as "Year" and label y axis as "Average Followers"
4. Question: Which district has increasing attention for recent years (increasing followers) and why? Hint: you may answer this question based on the information from the previous two plots 

**Followers of District 3 has increased rapidly for recent year, since it has the lowest average price and it is not too far from the center of the city**

```{r}
data %>% subset(year >= 2012) %>%
  group_by(year, district) %>% summarise(ave_price = mean(followers)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = ave_price, group = district, color = district)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2012, 2018, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 180, 20)) +
  labs(title = "Average Followers By District Over Time",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Followers")
```

### Q8 Use Boxplot to Demonstrate Price Quantiles of buildingType, buildingStructure, and renovationCondition with Following Instructions

1. Put three figures into one row.
2. Question: which buildingType tends to have higher average price? Answer the same question for buildingStructure and renovationCondition.

**Bunglow, Brick_Wood, and Hardcover tend to have higher average price**

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=8}
p1 = data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = buildingType, y = price)) +  
  geom_boxplot()

p2 = data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = buildingStructure, y = price)) +  
  geom_boxplot()

p3 = data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = renovationCondition, y = price)) +  
  geom_boxplot()

ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
```


### Q9 Create Density Plot of House Square by Building Type with Following Instructions

1. Use facet_wrap. The figure should contain 6 subplots
2. Question: Which building type do you think tend to be used to build house with smaller size? 

**Bungalow**

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=12}
data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(x = square)) +
  facet_wrap(~buildingType)
```


### Q10 On average, how much more (less) you need to pay price per square for house with subway nearby than house without subway? Answer the same question for elevator, and fiveYearsProperty

```{r}
data %>% group_by(elevator) %>% summarise(ave_price = mean(price)) %>% select(ave_price)
data %>% group_by(subway) %>% summarise(ave_price = mean(price)) %>% select(ave_price)
data %>% group_by(fiveYearsProperty) %>% summarise(ave_price = mean(price)) %>% select(ave_price)
```

### Q11 Display the Top 5 House Construction Time with Associated Counts
```{r}
data %>% group_by(constructionTime) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% arrange(-count) %>% 
  head(5) %>% kable()
```

### Q12 Create Correlation Plot for All Numerical Variables in this Dataset 

1. What are the top three most correlated (negative / positive) variables

**Bathroom and square, living room and square, community average and price per square**

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=12}
ggcorrplot(cor(data %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% select(-Lng, -Lat),
               use ="pairwise.complete.obs",method='pearson'), 
           hc.order = TRUE, 
           type = "lower",
           lab = TRUE)
```

## Summary

### Q13 From the above analysis, which variables do you think can be used to explain the resale house price?

**location (district), year (time), followers (demand), facility (subway, elevator)...**
